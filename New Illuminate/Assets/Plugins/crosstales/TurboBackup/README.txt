## Description
"Turbo Backup" is the fastest and safest way to backup your Unity project.
It only stores the difference between the last backup, this makes it incredible fast.

TB is the tool for dangerous situations in your project: make a backup as quick as possible before
any potential harmful change. And restore the project in seconds if a disaster happened.

Turbo Backup is a local backup and restore solution within Unity leaving other team members and VCS 
out of whatever crazy changes your thinking of doing.


After importing TB from the "Asset Store", open the Window menu and click "TurboBackup PRO".

Hit the "Backup" button to save your project. That's it. The plugin will do the rest.
TB will close Unity, save the necessary files and then restart Unity. 
If the backup is executed for the first time it will take some time to complete.

To restore a project to the latest backup, simply click on "Restore".
TB will close Unity, restore the necessary files and then restart Unity. 

Finally, because it creates and operates the "TB_backup" folder in your project directory, we've also included convenient
methods to ignore this folder for popular version control mechanisms (git, SVN and Mercurial).

Please read the "TurboBackup-doc.pdf" and "TurboBackup-api.pdf" for more details.



## Important
* Please be patient - TB is working as fast as your machine can but if you have large projects, it will need some time!
  After you hit the "Backup" or “Restore”-button, Unity closes and TB does all the work and restarts Unity. 
  Wait until it's finished or you risk a corrupt project.

* Always backup your project. TB was carefully designed and extensively tested. Nevertheless, it works on your filesystem
  and something could go wrong. If your project is corrupted, close Unity and delete the "Library"- and "TB_backup"-folders in
  your project. Unity will then re-import all assets for your current platform.
